# Thai2Katakana Translate

A program that tries to convert the Thai language into Katakana script

## Methods

This repo is merely a facade for the PyThaiNLP API that romanizes Thai words. The romanized Thai words are then passed to one of Wanakana's functions that converts the English alphabets into Katakana.

Constructive criticisms are highly appreciated as I am only just a beginner at coding. 😭🥐
